# Tasks

GPT-6 Luna implements; Sol owns refinement. All original and RB/RP tasks remain unchanged. Exact DAG: planning/host-principal-custody-amendment.json.

## 1. Trusted host custody

- [ ] 1.1 `HI-T01` Implement HI01: Trusted host custody; prerequisites BD-F01, LC-F01, PR-F01. Verify EV-HI01: the host rejects activation/request before privileged effects and preserves unrelated files. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## 2. Kernel enforced worker isolation

- [ ] 2.1 `HI-T02` Implement HI02: Kernel enforced worker isolation; prerequisites HI-T01, RG-F02. Verify EV-HI02: kernel controls deny each operation and the observation identifies actual UID, namespace and target; a mock denial is recorded separately. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## 3. Authoritative identity and recipient gating

- [ ] 3.1 `HI-T03` Implement HI03: Authoritative identity and recipient gating; prerequisites HI-T01, RG-F02. Verify EV-HI03: no host write or outbound alarm occurs; exact denial and secure resume fields are recorded without cached-claim fallback. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## 4. Mandatory native dispatch mediation

- [ ] 4.1 `HI-T04` Implement HI04: Mandatory native dispatch mediation; prerequisites HI-T02, HI-T03, PR-F03. Verify EV-HI04: no request or secret reaches the ineligible route and a directly invoked native bypass cannot evade the host boundary. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## 5. Ownership safe custody lifecycle

- [ ] 5.1 `HI-T05` Implement HI05: Ownership safe custody lifecycle; prerequisites HI-T01, HI-T02, LC-F04. Verify EV-HI05: prior owned generation is recovered safely or remains disabled; stale grant is rejected, unrelated bytes and credentials are preserved. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## 6. Separate native acceptance evidence

- [ ] 6.1 `HI-T06` Implement HI06: Separate native acceptance evidence; prerequisites HI-T02, HI-T03, HI-T04, HI-T05. Verify EV-HI06: implementation evidence remains distinct; target tasks stay open with exact next step and no full-compliance label. Deliver meaningful effect/failure tests and docs/host-principal-custody.md; keep implementation and actual-target acceptance separate.

## Workflow follow-up

- Preserve frozen baseline, all original aliases/obligations and RP/RB amendments; review exact native/account evidence before archive or canonical runtime sync.

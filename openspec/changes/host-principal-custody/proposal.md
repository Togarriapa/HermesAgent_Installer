# Proposal

## Why

The baseline requires actual host authorization and private/public runtime isolation. Profile names, injectable policy classes and transient user services cannot establish that custody; the concrete trusted host boundary must be specified before enabling native dispatch.

## What Changes

- Refine R0054/R0058/R0109/R0111/R0130/R0151/R0155 through append-only Sol amendment HI01..HI06 and separate implementation versus native acceptance tasks.
- Select root-owned host custody, distinct unprivileged service identities, kernel isolation and protected typed IPC, retaining all original obligations and AC05/06/08.
- Keep incomplete native wiring, account authority and target probes pending; no runtime acceptance or canonical runtime sync is claimed.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `host-principal-custody`: trusted host principal custody and mandatory mediated runtime dispatch.

### Modified Capabilities

None; pending baseline runtime specifications remain intact.

## Impact

Luna runtime authorization, provider/credential brokers, service generation, native Hermes tool binding and lifecycle adapters. Existing task bindings RG-F02, PR-F01/03, LC-F04 and planning/traceability.json remain authoritative. Supplemental DAG and exact tests are in planning/host-principal-custody-amendment.json. This change refines existing scope, adds no enrolled target/account, and changes no runtime code.

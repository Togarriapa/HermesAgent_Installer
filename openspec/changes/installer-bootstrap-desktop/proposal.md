# Proposal

## Why

The requested Pi setup needs fresh/adopted supported arm64 install, official agent/desktop version resolution, native user-session launch and truthful fallback. Existing source definitions and catalogs do not establish installed or target-tested behavior.

## What Changes

- Implement the full constraints and individual obligations assigned to `installer-bootstrap-desktop` in planning/traceability.json.
- Deliver component-specific functional/failure tests and account/hardware pending states rather than clone-only completion.
- Preserve existing data and keep all externally funded/account/device actions within configured scope.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `bootstrap-desktop`: Fresh/adopted supported ARM64 install, official Agent/Desktop version resolution, native user-session launch and truthful fallback.

### Modified Capabilities

None; no runtime capability is currently implemented in this greenfield repository.

## Impact

Planned modules: src/hermes_installer/preflight.py, src/hermes_installer/desktop.py, src/hermes_installer/bootstrap.py. Depends on the pinned planning/tooling baseline. All implementation belongs to GPT-6 Luna; specification/refinement belongs to GPT-6.1 Sol. See design.md and explicit task/evidence DAG.

Hermes/resource selection v3: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-hermes-bootstrap-resource-job-selection-v3.md defines fixed stage/health recipes and activegeneration resourcejob/DAG/source/backend joins; BD-F03/LC-F03/LC-F04/HI-T09/RB-T08 tasks and nativeevidence remainopen.

Protected lifecycle control v1: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-protected-lifecycle-control-v1.md defines exactrootprovision/currentintent/firstsnapshot/CASrecovery, finiteprocess.control facade andactualloadedclosureprooflimits. ExistingBD/LC/HI tasksremainopen.

Full Hermes source archive v2: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-full-hermes-source-archive-pin-v2.md and planning/protected-artifact-source-catalog.json pin complete official source/archive/export identity. Source staging is separate from runtime/install/native acceptance; existing BD/HI tasks stay open.

Build service/bootstrap provenance v7: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-build-service-bootstrap-record-provenance-v7.md defines exact dedicated build profile join and root-selected identity versus actual runtime receipt provenance. Existing HI/HW/BD/LC tasks remain open.

Root setup/journal selection v8: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-root-setup-session-journal-catalog-v8.md specifies installed root-local initial session/intent/receipt transport and active root journal catalog. Existing HI/BD/LC/SK tasks and target evidence remain open.

### v14 installed first setup

BD-F01/BD-F03/LC-F03/HI-T01 use root_local_setup_session installed_selection_catalog and first_setup_artifact_fetch in planning/protected-lifecycle-control-contract.json. Root deployment bytes and transaction-scoped CAS receipts are required; original acceptance remains open.

### v15 native health and typed admission

Use planning/protected-lifecycle-control-contract.json native_health_receipt for actual native health and planning/protected-resource-job-contract.json typed_admission/service_methods/recipe_domain for RB-T08. Original tasks/acceptance remain pending.

### v16 installed input closure joins

Use the exact installed_selection_catalog.release_root, task_runner_protocol.source_resolver and native-package-binding-contract.json initial_native_input_observer joins. Existing BD/HI/RB tasks and acceptance remain pending.

### v19 setup store and probe DTO

Use installed_selection_catalog artifact_catalog/artifact_store joins, root task canonical payload bytes and gateway_probe_response exact envelope. Existing BD/HI/RB tasks remain pending.

### v21 installed bootstrap policy source

Use installed_selection_catalog.bootstrap_policy_artifact explicit selected policy/template/receipt joins. Prepared records empty until actual runtime/health receipts; existing BD/LC/HI tasks remain pending.

### v22 runnable and health ordering

Use bootstrap_policy_artifact.activation_order: verified runnable custody publication precedes health observation, functional enablement follows actual passed current-generation health only. Existing acceptance remains pending.

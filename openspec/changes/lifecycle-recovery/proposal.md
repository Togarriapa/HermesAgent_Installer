# Proposal

## Why

The requested Pi setup needs wizard/cli, isolated environments, ownership-safe idempotent checkpoints, supervised services, rollback, backups and uninstall. Existing source definitions and catalogs do not establish installed or target-tested behavior.

## What Changes

- Implement the full constraints and individual obligations assigned to `lifecycle-recovery` in planning/traceability.json.
- Deliver component-specific functional/failure tests and account/hardware pending states rather than clone-only completion.
- Preserve existing data and keep all externally funded/account/device actions within configured scope.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `managed-lifecycle`: Wizard/CLI, isolated environments, ownership-safe idempotent checkpoints, supervised services, rollback, backups and uninstall.

### Modified Capabilities

None; no runtime capability is currently implemented in this greenfield repository.

## Impact

Planned modules: src/hermes_installer/cli.py, src/hermes_installer/config.py, src/hermes_installer/state.py, src/hermes_installer/lifecycle.py, src/hermes_installer/supervision.py. Depends on installer-bootstrap-desktop. All implementation belongs to GPT-6 Luna; specification/refinement belongs to GPT-6.1 Sol. See design.md and explicit task/evidence DAG.

Hermes/resource selection v3: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-hermes-bootstrap-resource-job-selection-v3.md defines fixed stage/health recipes and activegeneration resourcejob/DAG/source/backend joins; BD-F03/LC-F03/LC-F04/HI-T09/RB-T08 tasks and nativeevidence remainopen.

Protected lifecycle control v1: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-protected-lifecycle-control-v1.md defines exactrootprovision/currentintent/firstsnapshot/CASrecovery, finiteprocess.control facade andactualloadedclosureprooflimits. ExistingBD/LC/HI tasksremainopen.

Build service/bootstrap provenance v7: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-build-service-bootstrap-record-provenance-v7.md defines exact dedicated build profile join and root-selected identity versus actual runtime receipt provenance. Existing HI/HW/BD/LC tasks remain open.

Root setup/journal selection v8: plans/amendments/2026-10-09-root-setup-session-journal-catalog-v8.md specifies installed root-local initial session/intent/receipt transport and active root journal catalog. Existing HI/BD/LC/SK tasks and target evidence remain open.

### v14 installed first setup

BD-F01/BD-F03/LC-F03/HI-T01 use root_local_setup_session installed_selection_catalog and first_setup_artifact_fetch in planning/protected-lifecycle-control-contract.json. Root deployment bytes and transaction-scoped CAS receipts are required; original acceptance remains open.
